    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sedflux is a stratigraphic model to simulate basin fill. It deposits layers of sediment arriving from an incoming river into a marine basin. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important process simulated in Sedflux3D is delta plume sedimentation. This is being done by a module named 'Plume'. It assumes an incoming river with certain channel dimensions, and a given sediment concentration (for several grain size classes) and then calculates the resulting river plume dimensions upon entering in the marine domain.\n",
    "Settle rates are set for different grainsize classes and determine how rapidly sediment grains from the total sediment inventory settle out with distance from the river mouth. The theory behind the encoded plume dynamics originates from lab experiments (Albertson, 1950). Plume dynamics can be influenced by longshore currents or by Coriolis force and then result in a curved plume geometry. \n",
    "An additional important process is river mouth bedload deposition, separately calculated for the coarsest bedload grain size class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sedflux can be used in both 2D (a line model) and 3D (planview with layers of deposition). This notebook show you an example of the 3D sedflux version. \n",
